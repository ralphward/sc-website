Shimara Carlow was born in a remote coastal area in West Cork, Southern Ireland in 1979, a childhood fascination for collecting shells, stones, mermaid's purses, feathers and seed pods found along the sea shore has been the inspiration for her work.

Shimara completed a degree in Silversmithing and Jewellery in 2001, and went on to a 2 year residency at Bishopsland Workshops in South Oxfordshire

Shimara's jewellery has been inspired by natural forms, primarily seed pods. She uses silver, 18ct gold, silk paper and gum nuts to create her tactile jewellery. 
Collections include Gum Nut, neckpieces, rings and earrings constructed from both silver and real gum nuts and Honesty, whitened and reticulated silver ovals, which resemble honesty leaves, constructed in to long articulated neckpieces and bracelets. 
She also has several ranges in 18ct gold with precious stones such as diamonds, pink sapphire and aquamarine, including a selection of wedding and engagement rings.

New work Shimara has launched includes "acorn cup cluster", clusters of individual acorn cup units assembled to hang in long articulated chains which adorn the body. And a new silver and gold wrap range set with diamonds, along with a new selection of silver and 18ct gold engagement rings set with diamonds.

Shimara's silversmithing range is also based on pod structures; She creates small and large pod vessels, bowls, vases and tableware. 
Using fine silver and 24ct gold to create these pieces, which are all hand raised, form flat sheets of metal. Hammers and mallets are then used to add surface texture and decoration to the pieces. The vessels are constructed to be free standing and off centre, giving them a fluid natural quality.
New Silversmithing collections include Gum Nut and Pebble, clusters of small pod, leaf and pebble vessels using fine silver, oxidised silver and gold plate. Shimara has also been developing a new range of spoons, incorporating the silver Gum Nut's, ranging from Salt Spoons, up to Caddy and Table Spoons.

<p class="con_Right">
All pieces are hand made and unique, Shimara has a selection of work available to purchase at her studio. Shimara also works to commission, and will design and create an individual piece of jewellery or silverware. Please contact Shimara to make an appointment or discuss a commission.<br /><br />
